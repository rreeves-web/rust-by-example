Rust is a programming language that cares a lot about correctness and it
includes support for writing software tests within the language itself.

Testing comes in three styles:
- `Unit` testing.
- `Doc` testing.
- `Integration` testing.

Also Rust has support for specifying additional dependencies for tests:
- `Dev-dependencies`
