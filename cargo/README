`cargo` is the official Rust package management tool. It has lots of really
useful features to improve code quality and developer velocity! These include
- Dependency management and integration with crates.io (the official Rust package registry)
- Awareness of unit tests
- Awareness of benchmarks
This directory goes through quick basics, but the comprehensive documentation can be found
