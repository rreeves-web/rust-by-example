To add a build script to your package it can either be specified in the `Cargo.toml`
as follows:

BEGIN CODEBLOCK
[package]
...
build = "build.rs"
END CODEBLOCK

Or, Cargo will look for a `build.rs` file in the project directory by default.

How to use a build script:

The build script is simply another Rust file that will be compiled and invoked
prior to compiling anything else in the package. Hence it can be used to
fulfill pre-requisites of your crate.

Cargo provides the script with inputs via environment variables specified
here[url]https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/environment-variables.html#environment-variables-cargo-sets-for-build-scripts[/url]
that can be used.

The script provides output via stdout. All lines printed are written to
`target/debug/build/<pkg>/output`. Further, lines prefixed with `cargo:` will
be interpreted by Cargo directly and hence can be used to define parameters for
the package's compilation.

For further specification and examples have a read of the Cargo
specification[url]https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/build-scripts.html[/url].
