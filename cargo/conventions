Suppose that you want to have two binaries in the same project. What then?
It turns out that `cargo` supports this. The default binary name is `main`, as we
saw before, but you can add additional binaries by placing them in a `bin/` directory:

BEGIN CODEBLOCK
foo
    - Cargo.toml
    - src
        - main.rs # primary/first binary
        - bin
            - my_other_bin.rs # second binary
END CODEBLOCK

To tell `cargo` to compile or run this binary as opposed to the default or other
binaries, we just pass `cargo` the `--bin my_other_bin` flag, where `my_other_bin` is the
name of the binary we want to work with.

In addition to extra binaries, `cargo` supports [more features][url]https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/project-layout.html[/url]
such as benchmarks, tests, and examples.
