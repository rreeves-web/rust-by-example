// More importantly, some Rust types can't be written out. For example, every
// closure has its own unnamed concrete type. Before `impl Trait` syntax, you
// had to allocate on the heap in order to return a closure. But now you can do it
// all statically, like this:

// Returns a function that adds `y` to its input
fn make_adder_function(y: i32) -> impl Fn(i32) -> i32 {
    let closure = move |x: i32| { x + y };
    closure
}

fn main () {
    let plus_one = make_adder_function(1);
    assert_eq!(plus_one(2), 3);
}
