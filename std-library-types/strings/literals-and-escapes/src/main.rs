// There are multiple ways to write string literals with special characters in them.
// All result in similar `&str` so it's best to use the form that is the most
// convenient to write. Similarly there are multiple ways to write byte string
// literals, which all result in `&[u8; N]`.

// Generally special characters are escaped with a backslash character: `\`.
// This way you can add any character to your string, even unprintable ones and
// ones that you don't know how to type. If you want a literal backslash, escape
// it with another one: `\\`

// String or character literal delimiters occuring within a literal must be
// escaped: `"\""`, `'\''`.

    // You can use escapes to write bytes by their hexadecimal values...
