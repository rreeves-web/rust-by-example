// As a trait bound, it means the type does not contain any non-static references.
// Eg. the receiver can hold on to the type for as long as they want and it will never
// become invalid until they drop it.

// It's important to understand that this means that any owned data always passes a
// `'static` lifetime bound, but a reference to that owned data generally does not:
use std::fmt::Debug;

fn print_it( input: impl Debug + 'static ) {
    println!( "'static value passed in is: {:?}", input );
}

fn main() {
    // i is owned and contains no references, thus it's 'static:
    let i = 5;
    print_it(i);

    // oops, &i only has the lifetime defined by the scope of
    // main(), so it's not 'static:
    //print_it(&i);
}
