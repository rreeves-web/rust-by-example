// The notion of a destructor in Rust is provided through the `Drop`[url]https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Drop.html[/url] trait. The destructor is called
// when the resource goes out of scope. This trait is not required to be implemented for every type,
// only implement it for your type if you require its own destructor logic.

// Run the below example to see how the `Drop` trait works. When the variable
// in the `main` function goes out of scope the custom destructor
// will be invoked.
struct ToDrop;

impl Drop for ToDrop {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        println!("ToDrop is being dropped");
    }
}

fn main() {
    let x = ToDrop;
    println!("Made a ToDrop!");
}
