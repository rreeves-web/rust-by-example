"Associated items" refers to a set of rules pertaining to
`item`s[url]https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items.html[/url] of various
types. It is an extension to `trait` generics, and allows `trait`s to
internally define new items.

One such item is called an *associated type*, providing simpler usage patterns
when the `trait` is generic over its container type.
