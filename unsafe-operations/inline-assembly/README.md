Rust provides support for inline assembly via the `asm!` macro. It can be used to
embed handwritten assembly in the assembly output generated by the compiler.
Generally this should not be necessary, but might be where the required performance
or timing cannot be otherwise achieved. Accessing low level hardware primitives,
e.g. in kernel code, may also demand this functionality.

// Note: the examples here are given in x86/x86-64 assembly, but other
// architectures are also supported.

Inline assmebly is currently supported on the following architectures:
- x86 and x86-64
- ARM
- AArch64
- RISC-V
